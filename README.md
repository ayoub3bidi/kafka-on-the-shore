# Kafka
This was my sanbox to understand & try Kafka as an important technologie for every Back-end engineer.  

In this project I tried to create a **Topic**, **Producer**, and a **Consumer** with [kafkajs](https://github.com/tulios/kafkajs).  

I hope this can help you too :)

## Setup
```
docker-compose up
```
